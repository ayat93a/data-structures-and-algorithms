- A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

- Tree Traversal: Process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.
--> traversed in depth-first or breadth-first order.
- There are three common ways to traverse them in depth-first order: in-order, pre-order and post-order.

# Challenge Summary
Traverse a tree by breadth search first `BFS`

## Whiteboard Process
[Whiteboard](./breadth.PNG)

## Approach & Efficiency
space big O notation >> O(1)
time big O notation >> O(n)

## Solution
[Code](./trees/trees.py)
i have a problem in import queue from stack and queue -> actually its my mistake , i found that i have duplicatted that directory and when i remove a one copy of them the problem was started. 
i cant make a test until that this problem will be solved
