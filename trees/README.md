- A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

- Tree Traversal: Process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.
--> traversed in depth-first or breadth-first order.
- There are three common ways to traverse them in depth-first order: in-order, pre-order and post-order.
